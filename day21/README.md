Wow...for some strange reason, my algorithm for part 2, which seems to be the way most people have implemented it (keeping a track of whatever the comparison register 4 holds, as being compared to register 0 for equality and spotting when you come back to the same series again), has to scan through *3,412,966,280* execution steps before it finds the repeating loop, so it takes a LONG TIME to run.
